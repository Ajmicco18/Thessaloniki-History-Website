# Thessaloniki History Website

This website was created as a final project for my Thessaloniki: A City and its Inhabitants course.

I took this course as an elective when I studied abroad in Thessaloniki, Greece during the Fall 2024 semester.

This idea of the project was to illustrate a historical event that occurred in the city of Thessaloniki at any during 
the time period discussed in the course (Early 3rd century BC to late 20th century).

We were given two options to complete the project: 
- [Create a PowerPoint presentation of at least 10 slides ]
                    OR
- [Create a website from scratch]

Being a Computer Science major and have an interest in web development, I chose to develop a website myself. Therefore, 
I used React with Vite to design and develop this website illustrating the history behind The Great Thessaloniki of Fire of 1917.
